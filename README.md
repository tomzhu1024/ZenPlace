# ZenPlace
An interactive project inspired by magnet field which supports interaction with gestures.

This project has three parts:

- **Arduino** - works on Arduino, collects data from distance sensors and sends them to Processing
- **KinectHandTracker** - works on upper computer, collects gesture data from Kinect using official libraries and sends them to Processing
- **Processing** - works on upper computer, collects data from serial and renders particles

To run this project, you need to have both Kinect and Arduino connected to the upper computer.
